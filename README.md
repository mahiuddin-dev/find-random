# find-random

1.Select a random initial value between 0 and 1. Sets N=20 where N is the number of iterations to perform.
2.Iterate the initial value N times using the function f(x) = 4x (1-x).
3.At each iterate, you should determine whether that iterate is in the set A= [0,1/4], set B = [1/4,1/2], set C = [1/2,3/4], or set D = [3/4,1].
You need to create something that will count how many of the N+1 iterates (because you need to track the initial value) are in each of our four sets.
4.Make a histogram for how often your iterates are in each set,
